Data-Products-Project
=====================

This repo includes shiny app files ('ui.R' and 'server.R') for the Developing Data Products project. To see the deployment of this app, go to "https://mindmachine.shinyapps.io/Data-Prod/".

The application is simple to use and run. Simply adjust the slider widget to change the size of the population samples. The app then takes 1000 random samples of size 'n' (by adjusting the slider), finds the mean of each sample and constructs a distribution based on these means. You'll notice that the smaller the sample size, the less normal the curve looks. The purpose of this app is to help learners understand inference.
